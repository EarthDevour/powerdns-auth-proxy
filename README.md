# powerdns-auth-proxy

This proxy implements the `/zones` PowerDNS API endpoint but requires HTTP Basic authentication, and performs per-zone access control.

More information about the PowerDNS API is available at https://doc.powerdns.com/md/httpapi/api_spec/.

Future versions of this software will also support per-RRset ACLs.
